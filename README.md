# NYPD Arrests - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **NYPD Arrests Dataset** to uncover insights, trends, and patterns in arrests made by the New York Police Department. The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summaries to better understand the nature of arrests across different demographics, locations, and time periods.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains records of arrests made by the NYPD, including details such as:

- Arrest Date
- Arrest Location
- Age, Gender, and Race of the Person Arrested
- Arrest Offense Description
- Borough
- Jurisdiction Code
- Latitude & Longitude 

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis
- **Google Colab**: Interactive environment for EDA
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations

## 📊 Analysis & Insights

The notebook covers the following:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Formatting and standardizing columns
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of arrests by year, borough, and offense type
   - Demographic analysis (Age, Gender, Race)
   - Time series trends in arrest numbers
   - Mapping arrests using geospatial data
3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar charts, histograms, and pie charts for categorical data
   - Heatmaps and correlation matrices
   - Geospatial mapping of arrests

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NYPD_Arrests_EDA.git
   cd NYPD_Arrests_EDA
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run `NYPD_Arrests_EDA.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📌 Future Work

- **Machine Learning Models**: Predicting arrest trends
- **Time Series Analysis**: Deeper insights into seasonality and trends
- **Integration with External Data**: Weather, crime rates, etc.
